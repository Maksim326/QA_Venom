This guide covers: ✅ QA Workspace – Do you need it? (Pros, Cons, Benefits)
✅ Where to store test files (small files ~100 rows, 100 clients)
✅ How to store QA Automation Test Code & Azure Testing Function App
✅ Databricks Notebook Example (Raw Table & Transformation Validation)
✅ Terraform Deployment (for Databricks & Event Hub)
✅ Pipeline Execution Flowchart Alignment

1️⃣ Do You Need a QA Workspace?
A QA Workspace in Microsoft Fabric can be useful, but not mandatory if other services handle testing.

Pros (Why You Might Need It)	Cons (Why You Might Not Need It)
✅ Centralized workspace for storing test data & results	❌ Adds overhead if all tests are already handled via Databricks & Blob Storage
✅ Fabric Lakehouse stores test results for analysis (Power BI)	❌ If all test results are stored in Blob Storage, SQL DB, or Log Analytics, Fabric is redundant
✅ RBAC Control & Governance for test data	❌ Requires additional cost & maintenance
✅ Supports Spark-based validation (Fabric Notebooks)	❌ Databricks is often a better Spark solution
📌 Recommendation
🔹 If you need structured reporting & governance → Use a Fabric QA Workspace
🔹 If everything runs via Databricks & Blob Storage → Skip Fabric QA Workspace

2️⃣ Where to Store Test Files?
Since your test files (~100 rows, ~100 clients) will trigger pipeline execution (P1 in flowchart), you need a storage solution that supports event-based triggers.

Storage Option	Best For	Pros	Cons
Azure Blob Storage (Recommended)	Storing test files to trigger the pipeline	✅ Scalable & Cost-Effective
✅ Supports Event Grid & Event Hub
✅ Automatic versioning & retention policies	❌ Needs Azure Function App to trigger test execution
Git Repo (QA Automation Tests Repo)	Static test files that rarely change	✅ Version control (Git)
✅ Easy to rollback test cases	❌ Git cannot trigger event-based pipelines
Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS)	Managing large test datasets	✅ Supports structured file access	❌ Overkill for small test files
📌 Recommendation
Store test files in 🟢 Azure Blob Storage (Event-Driven)
Use Git for version-controlled test cases
File Naming Convention:
Each file prefixed with TF-{client_id}.csv
Example: TF-ClientA.csv, TF-ClientB.csv
3️⃣ How to Store QA Automation Test Code & Azure Testing Function App
Since test execution includes multiple Spark Jobs (Raw Table Validation, Transformation Validation), you need a structured Git repository.

📌 Recommended Repo Structure
bash
Copy
Edit
qa-automation-repo/
│── tests/                         # Automation test scripts
│   ├── test_runner.py
│   ├── integration_tests.py
│   ├── unit_tests.py
│── test_data/                      # Test files (if version-controlled)
│   ├── TF-ClientA.csv
│   ├── TF-ClientB.csv
│── azure_function/                 # Azure Testing Orchestration Function
│   ├── function_app.py
│   ├── requirements.txt
│   ├── host.json
│   ├── __init__.py

│   ├── transformation_validation.py
│── .gitignore
│── azure-pipelines.yml             # CI/CD for Function App + Databricks
│── README.md
📌 Key Takeaways
✅ QA Automation Tests & Azure Function stay in the same repo
✅ Blob Storage for test files (Git only for static test cases)
✅ Databricks Jobs stored in Git (Synced to Databricks via CI/CD)
