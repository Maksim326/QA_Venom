Summary

This proposal outlines the QA Automation Test Framework for Data Flow Testing in an Azure-based data pipeline. The framework ensures end-to-end validation of every pipeline step, automation of key tests, and integration with CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions. This enables a scalable, modular, and efficient validation process for data transformations.

Problem and/or Opportunity Overview

Data pipelines process large volumes of structured and semi-structured data. Ensuring the correct ingestion, transformation, and final storage of this data is crucial for data integrity and business insights.

Currently, manual validation of data flow results in:

Time-consuming & error-prone processes

Lack of automation and repeatability

No centralized testing repository

A QA Automation Test Framework will streamline validation, ensuring data integrity and correctness in an automated, scalable manner.

Proposed Solution/Design

Architecture

The QA Automation Test Framework will integrate with the Azure-based pipeline and automate validation for the following steps:

File ingestion & upload validation – Ensure correct files are received and moved to blob storage.

Raw table creation verification – Validate ingestion into the raw table.

Transformation validation – Ensure business logic and data transformations are correctly applied.

Final table validation – Validate correct storage and accessibility of transformed data.

Workflow Overview:

Test files are pushed to Inbound Path.

Azure Function processes the file and moves it to Blob Storage.

Azure Event Hub generates a correlation ID for tracking.

Automated tests are triggered:

Azure Function Tests verify file movement.

Raw Table Tests validate ingestion.

Transformation Tests confirm data correctness.

Final Table Tests validate storage.

Test results are published and reports generated.

Data Model

Test Files: Stored in Azure Blob Storage, containing ~100 rows per file for 100+ clients.

Raw Table: Stores ingested raw data.

Transformed Table: Stores data after business logic transformation.

Final Table: Stores data ready for reporting & analytics.

Interfaces

Azure Function App (Python) listens to Event Hub and triggers tests.

Pytest & Behave (BDD) used for test execution.

Azure Databricks (Spark Jobs) for validation of large datasets.

GitHub Actions for CI/CD automation.

Implementation Steps

1. Test File Management

Test files stored in Azure Blob Storage or Git repository.

Files uploaded to an inbound folder, triggering Event Hub processing.

2. Test Execution & Validation

Using correlation ID, framework validates data at each stage.

Raw Table validation verifies ingestion.

Transformation validation ensures business logic correctness.

Final Table validation ensures accurate storage.

3. CI/CD Integration

GitHub Actions triggers tests during deployment.

Test execution does not impact production.

Pipeline continues execution even if tests fail.

Framework Benefits

1. Automated Execution

GitHub Actions automates test execution and deployment, eliminating manual steps.

2. Scalability

New test cases can be added independently without modifying production code.

3. Modularity

All test logic is centralized in a dedicated QA Automation Test Framework repository.

Azure Testing Orchestration Function triggers tests at appropriate stages.

Additional Considerations

Monitoring and Logging Plan

Azure Monitor & Log Analytics track test execution and failures.

Event Hub correlation IDs provide traceability.

Availability Considerations

Azure Functions scale dynamically based on event volume.

Databricks Clusters are provisioned only when tests are needed.

Security Implications

RBAC applied to restrict access to test data.

Blob Storage versioning ensures auditability.

Backup and Retention Considerations

Test results stored in Blob Storage for 30 days.

Automated cleanup using Azure Functions.
