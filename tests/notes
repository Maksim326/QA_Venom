Using Original QA Workspace for Regression Tests

Why the Original QA Workspace Can Be Used

The original QA workspace can be utilized for Regression Tests, eliminating the need for an additional workspace. This approach simplifies resource management and ensures consistency across all testing phases.

Advantages of Reusing the Original QA Workspace

Cost Efficiency – No additional infrastructure is required, reducing cloud expenses.

Simplified Maintenance – Managing a single workspace is easier than maintaining multiple workspaces.

Consistency in Testing – Ensures that regression tests are executed in the same environment as functional and integration tests, reducing discrepancies.

Avoids Data Duplication – A single workspace prevents unnecessary duplication of test data and configurations.
