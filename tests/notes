Identifier	Generated By	Purpose	Can It Be Set by the Client?	Found in Microsoft.Storage.BlobCreated Event?
request_id	Azure Storage	Unique request tracking within Azure. Helps troubleshoot API calls and track requests in logs.	❌ No	✅ Yes
client_request_id	Client Application	Optional identifier set by the client for tracking requests across systems (e.g., logging & debugging).	✅ Yes	✅ If set by the client
etag	Azure Storage	Represents the version of a blob. Changes every time the blob is updated. Used for concurrency control.	❌ No	✅ Yes
Short Information for Each Identifier:
request_id → Assigned by Azure Storage, globally unique per request, useful for tracking in logs.
client_request_id → Set by the client to track a request across systems, appears in events if provided.
etag → Identifies the specific version of a blob, changes on updates, used for caching & concurrency.


You said:


1. request_id
Definition: A unique identifier generated by Azure Storage for each request processed by the service.​

Purpose:
Facilitates tracking and troubleshooting of individual requests within Azure's infrastructure.​
Appears in response headers, enabling clients to reference specific operations when seeking support or analyzing logs.​
Assists in correlating client-side activities with server-side operations for comprehensive monitoring.​

Documentation:
For more details on request_id and its role in Azure Storage operations, refer to the https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/lease-container?tabs=microsoft-entra-id


2. client_request_id
Definition: An optional, client-generated identifier included in a request to Azure Storage, intended to correlate client-side activities with server-side operations.​


Purpose:

Allows clients to assign a unique ID to each request, aiding in tracking and debugging from the client's perspective.​
When included, Azure logs this ID, making it easier to trace and correlate specific client requests with server-side logs.​
Enhances end-to-end visibility of operations, especially useful in complex systems where multiple services interact.​
Documentation:

For guidance on setting and using client_request_id, consult the https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/lease-container?tabs=microsoft-entra-id


3. etag
Definition: A unique identifier representing a specific version of a resource (e.g., a blob) in Azure Storage. The etag changes with each modification to the resource.​

Purpose:

Enables optimistic concurrency control by allowing clients to perform conditional operations based on the etag value.​
Ensures clients are working with the correct version of a resource, preventing accidental overwrites.​
Assists in cache validation by helping clients determine if a resource has changed since it was last fetched.​
Documentation:

For an in-depth explanation of etag and its applications, see the https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/concurrency-manage
These identifiers play crucial roles in ensuring reliable and efficient interactions with Azure Storage services.
