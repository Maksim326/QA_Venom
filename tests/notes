File Upload Validation Tests

Valid File Upload Test
Upload a valid file (correct extension and non-empty).
Verify that the file appears in the Inbound folder.

Invalid File Extension Test
Upload a file with an unsupported extension.
Verify that the file is rejected and does not trigger further processing.

Empty File Upload Test
Upload an empty file (0 bytes).
Ensure the pipeline does not process the file and logs an error.

Duplicate File Upload Test
Upload the same file twice.
Verify that the system correctly handles duplicate file uploads (either overwrites, rejects, or versions the file(s)).

After a valid file is uploaded, verify that a corresponding Azure Storage Blob is created.

Blob Metadata Validation Test
Ensure the created blob contains correct metadata (e.g., filename, timestamp, eTag).

Verify that the uploaded file in Blob Storage is accessible and not corrupted.


Raw Table Creation Validation Tests
After a valid file upload, verify that an entry for the file is created in the Raw Table.
