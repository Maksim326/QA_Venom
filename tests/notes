Option 1: Reuse the Original QA Workspace for Regression Tests
✅ Pros

Cost-Effective → No additional infrastructure or workspace setup required.
Easier Maintenance → No need to manage multiple workspaces.
Ensures Consistency → Regression tests run in the same environment as other tests.
❌ Cons

Resource Contention → Regression tests may interfere with ongoing QA testing.
Parallel Execution Limitations → Long-running regression tests may slow down other test cycles.
Environment Stability → Frequent test executions may make debugging difficult.
📝 Best For:

If test runs are scheduled and do not interfere with active testing.
When test data and configurations remain the same for all test types.
Option 2: Create a Separate QA Workspace for Regression Tests
✅ Pros

Dedicated Resources → No impact on active QA testing.
Parallel Test Execution → Faster test cycles by running regression tests independently.
Isolated Test Data & Configurations → Avoids conflicts between regression and functional tests.
❌ Cons

Additional Cost → Maintaining multiple workspaces increases resource usage.
More Management Overhead → Requires setting up, maintaining, and syncing test data across workspaces.
Duplication of Data → Separate storage may be needed for test results and logs.
📝 Best For:

When regression tests require a stable environment without frequent deployments.
If tests are long-running and need isolated execution.
When multiple teams are working on different test phases simultaneously.
📌 Final Recommendation
Scenario	Best Approach
Regression tests run on the same schedule as other QA tests	✅ Reuse the original QA workspace
Regression tests need to run frequently & independently	✅ Create a separate QA workspace
Limited test resources & cost concerns	✅ Reuse the existing workspace
Parallel execution of regression & functional tests needed	✅ Separate QA workspace recommended
