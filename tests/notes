Do We Need a QA Workspace?
1.1 Test Execution Results
Test execution results need a dedicated environment to store logs, test artifacts, and validation reports.
Ensures isolation from Dev and Prod environments to prevent interference.
Facilitates consistent debugging without affecting production data.
1.2 Files Created from Pipeline with Test Execution
Any files generated during test execution (e.g., intermediate datasets, transformed tables) should have a designated storage location.
Helps in troubleshooting failed tests by keeping raw and transformed data available.
Needs a cleanup strategy to prevent unnecessary storage costs.
Benefits of Having a QA Workspace
Pros	Details
Supports Data Testing Spark Jobs	A separate QA workspace enables running Spark jobs without interfering with Dev/Prod workloads.
Isolated from Dev Workspace	Prevents test execution from affecting Dev and Prod environments.
Mimics Data Pipeline for QA	Provides a realistic testing environment that simulates production data transformations.
Cons of Having a QA Workspace
Cons	Details
Additional Cost & Maintenance	A QA workspace requires additional resources, including compute, storage, and maintenance.
Complexity in Managing Data Isolation	Requires defining clear access control policies to ensure QA data does not mix with Dev or Prod.
Potential Duplication of Storage & Compute	If a separate QA workspace is used, duplicate data and Spark job runs could lead to inefficiencies.
Key Considerations
If Using CDE Offshore

Need clarity on handling test result files and final pipeline execution files.
Define a data retention & cleanup policy.
Level of Isolation

Should QA have its own workspace or use a shared Lakehouse?
Define the level of separation between QA, Dev, and Prod.
QA SJD

Will QA have its own SJD (Security & Job Definition) or use Dev SJD?
Logging Strategy

QA logs should follow the same structure as Dev and Prod (but tagged as QA).
Ensure traceability of tests using correlation IDs.
Solution
Best Practice: It is better to have a separate QA workspace to ensure proper isolation and prevent conflicts with Dev/Prod environments.
Alternative: If a separate workspace is not feasible, use the Dev environment carefully with proper test data isolation.











Where to Store Test Files Similar to Client Files?
Each client test file contains approximately 100 rows and needs to be stored efficiently for test execution and validation. Below are two storage options:

Option 1: Store in Git Repo with Test Code and Azure Testing Function
‚úÖ Pros
Good for files that rarely change.
Provides Version Control (track changes, rollback if needed).
Easy to rollback test cases when updates are required.
Fewer service dependencies, as files are stored alongside test scripts.
‚ùå Cons
Not suitable for frequently changing files.
No event-driven execution (tests need to be manually triggered).
Limited scalability for managing large datasets.
üìù Notes
Best for static or predefined test data.
Works well when test cases are closely tied to automation code.
Requires manual updates if test data needs to evolve with pipeline changes.
Option 2: Store in Azure Blob Storage (In Pipeline)
‚úÖ Pros
Enables automated test execution (files trigger pipeline events).
Scalable (handles large datasets easily).
Supports Event Hub (triggers Azure Functions when files are uploaded).
Automatic versioning (keeps track of file history).
Works seamlessly with Azure Function and CI/CD Pipelines.
‚ùå Cons
Requires Azure Function to process and trigger tests.
Additional management overhead compared to Git storage.
Access control considerations (ensure correct permissions).
üìù Notes
If using real client-like data, Azure Blob Storage is preferred.
For simulated test cases, Git repo storage is sufficient.
If test files evolve over time, Blob Storage provides better flexibility.
Final Recommendation
‚úî If test files are static ‚Üí Store them in Git repo with test code.
‚úî If test files need automation & event-driven execution ‚Üí Store them in Azure Blob Storage.

üí° Clarification Needed:

Will test files be generated dynamically or will they be pre-created and updated manually?
Do we need historical tracking of test files for debugging?
Would you like a hybrid approach (Git for base files, Blob for real-time testing)? üöÄ
