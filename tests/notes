Proposal: QA Automation Test Framework for Data Flow Testing
Introduction
This proposal outlines the design and implementation of a QA Automation Test Framework for Data Flow Testing in an Azure-based pipeline. The framework will ensure that every step in the pipeline is validated, automated, and integrated with CI/CD to ensure data integrity and system reliability. It is designed to be modular, scalable, and maintainable while keeping all test logic centralized in a dedicated QA Automation Test Framework repository.

Objective
The primary objectives of the QA Automation Test Framework include:

Automate Testing for Key Pipeline Steps, including:
File ingestion and upload validation
Raw table creation verification
Transformation step validation
Final table validation
Centralized Test Logic in a dedicated QA Automation Test Framework repository.
Ensure that tests run only during CI/CD execution, not in production.
Leverage GitHub Actions for automated testing, integration, and deployment.
Data Pipeline Execution with Tests
The following steps outline how the testing framework integrates with the data pipeline:

Test files are pushed to the raw path for execution.
Azure function receives the file and moves it to blob storage.
Azure Event Hub generates a correlation ID, which is used to track the data flow.
Automated tests validate each stage of data processing:
Azure function tests ensure file reception and movement to blob storage.
Raw table tests verify data ingestion.
Transformation tests validate business logic applied to raw data.
Final table tests ensure correct data storage and accessibility.
Test results are published, and reports are generated.
Overview of the Framework
The framework consists of the following components:

1. QA Automation Test Framework
A dedicated repository for all test logic.
Contains test cases for each stage of the pipeline.
Uses pytest for execution and assertion validation.
2. Azure Testing Orchestration Functions
Orchestrates the execution of tests for different pipeline stages.
Ensures the correct test cases are triggered at each stage.
Reads event data and correlation IDs to track and validate the data flow.
Tools & Technologies
Python for writing test scripts.
Pytest for executing test cases and validating assertions.
Azure Functions to trigger and execute tests.
Event Hub for tracking correlation IDs across the pipeline.
GitHub Actions for test execution as part of CI/CD.
Scheduler for triggering tests during CI/CD pipeline execution.
Implementation Steps
Test File Management

Test files will be stored in the test repository or a dedicated blob storage.
These files will be uploaded to an inbound folder, and the Azure function will generate a correlation ID for tracking.
Test Execution & Validation

Using the correlation ID and file path, the framework will validate data ingestion.
Tests will verify raw table creation, transformation steps, and final table correctness.
CI/CD Integration

Tests will be executed only during CI/CD runs using GitHub Actions.
If a test fails, the pipeline execution will halt to prevent invalid data propagation.
Benefits of the Framework
Automated Execution

GitHub Actions automates test execution and deployment, eliminating manual intervention.
Scalability

New test cases can be added independently without modifying production code.
Modularity

All test logic is centralized in the QA Automation Test Framework repository, avoiding duplication across repositories.
Simplified Data Flow
Push Sample Files → 2. Azure Function receives & moves file to Blob Storage → 3. Raw Table Created → 4. Transformations Applied → 5. Final Table Created
Automated tests validate each step and publish test reports.
Next Steps
Set up the QA Automation Test Framework repository.
Develop Pytest-based test scripts for each pipeline stage.
Integrate test execution with GitHub Actions.
Deploy Azure testing orchestration functions.
Monitor and refine automation as required.
