Git Repository for Both Test Files and Automation Code

Since files are small, you can store them directly in the same Git repository as your test automation code.
Organize files by client to maintain clarity.
File Structure Example

├── test-automation/
│   ├── scripts/
│   │   ├── test_runner.py
│   │   ├── utils.py
│   ├── tests/
│   │   ├── client_A/
│   │   │   ├── test_data_1.csv
│   │   │   ├── test_data_2.txt
│   │   ├── client_B/
│   │   │   ├── test_data_1.csv
│   │   │   ├── test_data_2.txt
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── .gitignore
Pros of This Approach

Version Control: Git will track changes, making it easy to roll back if needed.
Easy Collaboration: Team members can access test files along with automation scripts.
Simple Organization: Storing files under a structured directory ensures clarity.
Alternative: Git LFS (Large File Storage)

If files grow larger over time, Git LFS can help manage them without bloating the repository.


Storage Option	Pros	Cons	Best Use Case
Git (Version Control) – Store test files in the same repo as test automation code ✅ (Recommended Option)	- Simple setup, everything versioned together
- Easy rollback and tracking changes
- No extra tools required	- Repo may become large over time if files increase
- Merge conflicts if multiple people edit the same file	Best for small test files that require frequent versioning and tracking.
Git + LFS (Large File Storage)	- Keeps repo lightweight while versioning large files
- Git history remains manageable	- Requires Git LFS setup
- Some Git hosting providers limit LFS usage	If files start growing beyond small sizes (~100KB each).
Cloud Storage (AWS S3, Azure Blob, Google Cloud Storage)	- Scalable, can handle more files over time
- Access control and file versioning supported	- Requires cloud setup
- Versioning is external to Git	Best for large-scale test data, especially if automation needs cloud storage.
Database (PostgreSQL, MySQL) for Metadata + Cloud Storage for Files	- Structured query support for test data
- Scalable and centralized	- More complex setup
- Overhead for managing DB and storage separately	When test files need metadata indexing for advanced searches.
Local File System (Organized Directories on a Shared Server)	- Simple and accessible
- No need for external services	- No built-in versioning
- Risk of accidental file deletion or overwrites	Suitable for quick access but not ideal for tracking changes.
