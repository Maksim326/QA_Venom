1. File Upload Validation Tests
✅ Verify that a file can be successfully uploaded to the inbound folder.
✅ Verify that files with valid extensions (e.g., .csv, .parquet, .json) are accepted.
✅ Verify that files with invalid extensions (e.g., .exe, .txt, .zip) are rejected.
✅ Verify that an empty file is rejected and does not trigger further processing.
✅ Verify that a large file within the allowed size limit is successfully uploaded.
✅ Verify that a file exceeding the allowed size limit is rejected.
2. Azure Function Execution Tests
✅ Verify that the Azure Function is triggered upon file upload.
✅ Verify that the function logs file metadata (e.g., name, size, timestamp).
✅ Verify that the function correctly moves the file from the inbound folder to the appropriate Azure Storage Blob location.
✅ Verify that the function assigns a correlation ID to the uploaded file.
3. Azure Storage Blob Validation Tests
✅ Verify that a storage blob is created for a valid uploaded file.
✅ Verify that the blob path follows the expected directory structure.
✅ Verify that the blob contains the same data as the original uploaded file.
✅ Verify that metadata such as file name, size, and timestamp is correctly stored.
✅ Verify that an invalid or empty file does not create a blob in Azure Storage.
4. Raw Table Creation Tests
✅ Verify that a valid uploaded file triggers the creation of a raw table.
✅ Verify that the raw table contains the correct schema and structure.
✅ Verify that all records from the uploaded file are correctly ingested into the raw table.
✅ Verify that duplicate file uploads do not create duplicate records in the raw table.
✅ Verify that files with incorrect schemas or missing mandatory columns are rejected.
5. Error Handling & Logging Tests
✅ Verify that an error log is generated if the file fails validation (e.g., invalid format, empty file).
✅ Verify that processing errors (e.g., Azure Function failure, storage failure) are logged correctly.
✅ Verify that alerts/notifications are triggered for failed uploads.
✅ Verify that a retry mechanism is available for transient failures.
