Proposal: QA Automation Test Framework for Data Flow Testing
Introduction.
This proposal outlines the design and implementation of a QA Automation Test Framework for Data Flow Testing in an Azure-based pipeline. The framework will ensure that every step in the pipeline is validated, automated, and integrated with CI/CD 
 

Objective
The primary objectives of the QA Automation Test Framework include:
1.	Automate Testing for Key Pipeline Steps, including:
•	File ingestion and upload validation
•	Raw table creation verification
•	Transformation step(s) validation
•	Final table validation
2.	Centralized Test Logic in a dedicated QA Automation Test Framework repository.
3.	Ensure that tests run only during CI/CD execution, not in production.
4.	Leverage GitHub Actions for automated testing, integration, and deployment. 
Data Pipeline Execution with Tests
The following steps outline how the testing framework integrates with the data pipeline:
1.	Test files are pushed to the Inbound path for execution.
2.	Azure function receives the file (eTag is created after uploading file), creates blob storage and moves it to blob storage.
3.	Azure Event Hub generates a correlation ID (select using eTag), which is used to track the data flow.
4.	Automated tests validate each step of data processing:
•	Azure function tests ensure file reception and movement to blob storage.
•	Raw table tests verify data ingestion.
•	Transformation tests validate business logic applied to raw data.
•	Final table tests ensure correct data storage and accessibility.
5.	Test results are published, and reports are generated.
Overview of the Framework
The framework consists of the following components:
1. QA Automation Test Framework
•	A dedicated repository for all test logic.
•	Contains test cases for each stage of the pipeline.
•	Uses pytest for execution and assertion validation.
2. Azure Testing Orchestration Functions
•	Orchestrates the execution of tests for different pipeline steps.
•	Ensures the correct test cases are triggered at each step.
•	Reads event data and correlation IDs to track and validate the data flow for uploaded file(s).

Tools
•	Python for writing test scripts.
•	Pytest for executing test cases and validating assertions.
•	Azure Functions to trigger and execute tests.
•	Event Hub for tracking correlation IDs across the pipeline.
•	GitHub Actions for test execution as part of CI/CD.
•	Scheduler for triggering tests during CI/CD pipeline execution. 


Implementation Steps
1.	Test File Management
•	Test files will be stored in the test repository or a dedicated blob storage.
•	These files will be uploaded to an inbound folder, and the Azure function will generate a correlation ID for tracking.
2.	Test Execution & Validation
•	Using the correlation ID and file path, the framework will validate data ingestion.
•	Tests will verify raw table creation, transformation steps, and final table correctness.
3.	CI/CD Integration
•	Tests will be executed only during CI/CD runs using GitHub Actions.
•	If a test fails, the pipeline execution will continue.

Framework Benefits:
1.	Automated Execution
•	GitHub Actions automates test execution and deployment, eliminating manual intervention.
2.	Scalability
•	New test cases can be added independently without modifying production code.
3.	Modularity
•	All test logic is centralized in the QA Automation Test Framework repository, avoiding duplication across repositories.
